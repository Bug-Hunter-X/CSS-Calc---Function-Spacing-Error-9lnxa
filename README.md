# CSS Calc() Function Spacing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in using the `calc()` function in CSS: incorrect spacing around the operators. The `bug.css` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the correct version.

The error occurs when spaces are omitted around the `+` and `-` operators. This can lead to unexpected results or parse errors.  The solution involves ensuring that spaces are present around these operators.

This is a simple example highlighting the importance of proper syntax in CSS.
